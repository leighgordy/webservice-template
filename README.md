# webservice-template
A basic web service template for use in my future projects. Might be pants though as its my first JS webservice

##Commands
`npm run build` - Build the application using webpack  
`npm run serve` - serve the webservice on port 3000

## Why are you using webpack ?!?!?
Normally I would not, its definitely overkill for solely a backend service. However, I plan to use this as part of a full stack application, and the frontend will certianly use webpack. I'm just trying to keep the configuration consistent across all my projects.
